            <h3>Fin del Mundo</h3>
            <h2>Ushuaia, the southernmost city</h2>
            <p>
              The city of Ushuaia is at the tip of South America on the south
              coast of Isla Grande, the largest island of the Tierra del Fuego
              archipelago in Patagonia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Isla Grande, half of which belongs to Chile, is separated from the
              rest of the continent by the Strait of Magellan. Ushuaia’s
              isolation is reinforced by the barriers of the Andes inland, and
              the ocean stretching to Antarctica.
            </p>
            <p>
              All that isolation, however, is part of the appeal. Surrounded by
              raw nature, whipped by winds from the South Pole, you can feel the
              fragility, and wonder of life in a place that will stay always in
              your memory.

                <h5>Parque Nacional Tierra Del Fuego</h5>
                <p>
                  Tierra del Fuego Natioanl Park was created in 1960 and has a
                  surface of 68.909 hectares of Patagonian forests. Located at
                  12 kilometers west of Ushuaia, it is the only national park in
                  Argentina with a coastline. Inside the park you can hike
                  multiple trails that vary in length and difficulty. The HITO
                  XXIV Trail takes you close to the border with Chile. The park
                  also has visitors center, restaurant and a gift shop.

                  The trip starts at a gate located at the bottom of the Andorra
                  Valley, about 8 kilometers from the center of Ushuaia. You
                  have to go through a large peat bog, and walk along the left
                  bank of a stream called Arroyo Grande. Once you cross the
                  bridge you will enter the forest, where the path starts to
                  ascend. When you reach the end of the forest, you will see the
                  last stretch of the trail: a rocky slope that leads to the
                  Laguna de los Témpanos.

                <p>
                  At the start of the trail the dominant vegetation is the lenga
                  forest, a native tree of the area. Walk through a sector with
                  foliage and peat bogs, until you reach a high mountain
                  environment, around 600 meters above sea level. Once you reach
                  the lagoon, appreciate the majestic environment of forest and
                  snow-capped peaks that surround it. The greenish color of its
                  waters is due to the sediment coming from the Ojo del Albino
                  Glacier.

            Hi, my name is Rosa. I traveled in the southern part of Argentina
            and Chile in 2024. I had the most amazing experience which is why I
